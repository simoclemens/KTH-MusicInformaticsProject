    "### Task and purpose of the project\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create an automatic mixer based on key and beat detection. <br>\n",
    "The core idea is to start from a series of segments and mix them in the best possible way considering both BPM and key similarity.\n",
    "### Musical lineup creation\n",
    "Once we have computed the estimated key and bpm for each track it is time to order them in order to create an actual lineup. <br>The basic idea behind this process is to find tracks which are similar to each others and put them one close in order to have a seamless passage.\n",
    "In order to define the similarity we could consider a 2D-dimensional plane with key and bpm as axis: our target is to find the closest neighbors of our current track. Since summing together the distances in terms of key and bpm is not simple, we decided to use an approach derived from the classical mixing theory.\n",
    "##### Key similarity\n",
    "In order to find the similarity between keys we decided to apply the Camelot Wheel: this wheel is composed by two circles, the outer representing major keys and the inner for minor keys. It is often used for mixing since it indicates the keys which works well together: as a matter of fact, each key sounds well with the two neighbors in its circle and with the correspondent element from the other circle. In this way, once we select a track, we can divide the 2D plane in horizontal segments and select only those which have a key admissible from the Camelot rule.\n",
    "##### BPM similarity\n",
    "Since we used the key to segment the plane now the nearest neighbors search can be done in 1D using simply the BPM difference between two tracks as similarity measure. Usually DJs tend to increase the BPM of the mix with time: to mimic this behaviour we inserted an additional constraint related to the tempo. As a matter of fact we only consider the tracks with BPM higher or equal to the current one. In this way, the next piece will be the track with the most similar BPM to the actual one only considering those from the selected group of keys and having a faster tempo.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are working with two features so the first idea was to apply a simple 2-dimensional nearest neighbor search to find the closest\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "We will work with annotated datasets in order to have ground truth for beat and key. (For instance: https://zenodo.org/record/3967852)\n",
    "Our projects aims to estimate both keys and bpm from a given segment. <br><br>\n",
